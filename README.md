## Stanford CS106L: Standard C++ Programming

This repo contains my assignments solutions for [Stanford CS106L C++ course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/)

## Why learning C++

C++ is considered a widely used language, its community is huge in it has been out there for 40 years! it's used for projects that requires high performance and heavy computing, almost all Mahcine learning libraries like *TensorFlow* and *PyTorch* backends are built with C++. Not mentioning its wide usage in game development, like the famous game engine *Unreal Engine*

However, my main goal at the current time for learning C++ is filling the prerequisite for [Stanford CS 144: Introduction to Computer Networking](https://cs144.github.io/) which uses C++ for teaching.

One of the great things in this course that each of  the assignments comes with its own autograder so you test you solution locally
